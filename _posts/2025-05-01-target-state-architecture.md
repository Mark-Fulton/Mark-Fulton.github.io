When you are coding an app, what are you doing / changing in there that will leave you and the code in a better place?

When developers are creating an app, we (should) make sure that we are all developing to the  architecture that has been created and agreed upon by all developers. During this beginning phase, we are able to make sure that the code in all areas matches the expectations  within this high level architecture. 

But... what happens when you are working on a codebase that isn't as quick / easy to change? Enter, the Target State Architecture. 

## What is the definition of Target State Architecture?

When the codebase cannot all change at once or within a month, there is a need to document the way we want the end state to look like this is no different to a High level Architecture Update, however, Target State architecture outlines the steps to get to this end goal. 

With this definition, this allows us to understand that the codebase will be in an interim area, between not implemented and implemented. However what this allows is the ability to change the codebase in time, as well as celebrate the key steps to get to it.
